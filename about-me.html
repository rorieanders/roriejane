  <h3 style="display: flex; text-indent: 0;">ABOUT ME</h3><br />
    <p style="display:flex;">
      I wasn't always in the Technical Communication field. Initially, I started off fascinated with the world of Psychology with a deep interest in therapeutic interventions for adolescents. I was particularly interested in work surrounding international adoption and post-adoption services. So, for over six years I held multiple jobs centered around providing support services to families and children with a focus in mental health and child development. In 2018 I obtained a Master of Social Work from the University of Minnesota with a concentration in families and children. After some time in child protective services, I desired a change in career, one that was more geared to my love of writing and design. It was by sheer luck that I was introduced to the concepts of Learning and Development and the field of Technical Communication.<br />

      <br />Currently, I am a skilled Technical Writer and Graphic Designer with expertise in content standardization, technical illustration, and product-based documentation for residential audio visual products. I exhibit superb written and verbal communication skills, display excellent attention to detail, and am proficient in Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.  Experienced with SolidWorks Composer to manipulate 3D product models, analyze engineering drawings, and review bills of material to develop user-friendly installation and how-to instructions. I am currently enrolled as a graduate student pursuing my M.S. in Scientific and Technical Communication from the University of Minnesota. I also have a certificate in Instructional Design for eLearning from the University of Minnesota.</p><br/>


    <h3 style="display: flex; text-indent: 0;margin-left: .90em; margin-right: 2.4em;">WHY THE COMPLETE CAREER CHANGE?</h3><br />
      <p style="display: flex; margin-left: 1.4em; margin-right: 2.4em;">
        While my role as a social worker was exceedingly rewarding, I found that the task that I enjoyed the most was completing documentation - writing court documents, treatment plans, and comprehensive evaluations. Therefore, with my social work background, I transferred my passion for efficient, interactive documentation and media into my newfound passion for technical communication. By translating complex instructional designs to a diverse audience, I have assisted in copyediting, testing, and producing handbooks and manuals with a user-centered design process.</p><br />



      <h3 style="display: flex; text-indent: 0; margin-left: .9em; margin-right: 2.4em;">WHAT ELSE ABOUT ME?</h3><br />
        <p style="display: flex; margin-left: 1.4em; margin-right: 2.4em">
          Outside of work and school, I am a member of the Professional Association for Computer Training (PACT) and currently serve on the Board of Directors. As the Vice Communication Chair, I assist with PACT event publicity and marketing as well as design and publish social media posts. I am also a member of the AIGA, the Professional Association for Design. In my free time, I enjoy reading, journaling, and cooking.</p><BR />
