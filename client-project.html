<h3 style="margin-left: 1.2em; text-indent: 0px;">CLIENT PROJECT PARAMETERS</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 1.9em; margin-right: 2.3em">Professor Daniel Card of the University of Minnesota connected with an external client, Daphne Walmer and the Minnesota Austin Healey Club (MAHC), to discuss the client’s desire to update the MAHC website. Through an initial interview with Daphne, teams of students obtained details on the current and desired state of the club’s website. Teams then analyzed, planned, and prototyped web design recommendations to assist MAHC as they consider transitioning to a new site in the future. The following project details oitline Team Red's efforts to produce website recommendations for the MAHC website.</p2>
<br />

<h3 style="margin-left: 1.2em; text-indent: 0px;">PROJECT PROCESSES</h3><br />
<h3 style="margin-left: 3em; text-indent: 0px; color: black; font-size: 28px;">Audience Needs Analysis</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 2.3em">Team Red implemented a content strategy by conducting a needs analysis (see <a href="resources/NeedsAnalysis.pdf">Appendix A</a>) of the current MAHC website to identify and evaluate specific deficiencies, areas for improvement, and logistical considerations. This allowed the team to dissect details and organize subsequent design strategies. As Redish (2012) notes, “Design has to support meaningful content, so we should evaluate design and content together” (p. 47). Therefore, Team Red made efforts to better align the goal and purpose of the site to produce the desired outcome for site visitors. Incorporating a needs analysis into the process helped the team know the audience and their realities and encouraged more successful conversations with the site visitors. According to Redish (2012), "A website is successful only if site visitors can<br />
     <ul3 style="margin-left: 3em;">
         <li>find what they need;</li><br />
         <li>understand what they find;</li><br />
         <li>act appropriately on that understanding;</li><br />
         <li>do all that in the time and effort that htey are willing to spend" (p. 20).</li><br />
     </ul3>
</p2><br />

<h3 style="margin-left: 3em; text-indent: 0px; color: black; font-size: 28px;">Initial Wireframe Designs</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 2.3em">In a follow-up interview, Daphne noted that the current web administrators are ready to step out of their role and Daphne will be solely responsible for site maintenance in the short term. Due to these changes, she expressed interest in a system that prioritizes ease of use without having to learn markup or scripting languages for web building. Additionally, Daphne reported wanting a system whose maintenance can easily be taught or transferred over to someone else.<br /><br />

With these considerations in mind, Team Red opted to use a wireframe to draft team ideas and recommendations. A wireframe “is a two-dimensional illustration of a page’s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors (Wireframing, n.d.). Utilizing Balsamiq, a web-based mockup tool, Team Red created a homepage and Join the Club wireframe (see <a href="resources/wireframev2.png">Appendix B</a>, <a href="resources/wireframe.png">Appendix C</a>, <a href="resources/MAHC-Mobile.png">Appendix D</a>). These wireframes acted as a simplified representation of every important piece desired within the final product (Treder, 2016).<br /><br />

A successful website allows site visitors to obtain the information they need to answer their questions or aids in completing a task. As Redish (2012) notes, “They want the information to be easy to find, easy to understand, accurate, up to date, and credible” (p. 1). Therefore, Team Red worked on reformatting the site layout to better fit the site’s conversation with the visitors. According to Redish (2012), “A useful home page<br />
<ul3 style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <li>makes it instantly clear what the site is all about;</li><br />
    <li>is mostly links and short descriptions;</li><br />
    <li>act appropriately on that understanding;</li><br />
    <li>includes calls to action (verb phrases) for your primary site visitors that respond to the conversations they came to have” (p. 78).</li><br />
</ul3><br /><br />

Within the wireframe, content was chunked based upon topic or task. Section titles were presented as questions that site visitors would ask. This encouraged a dialogic flow of the content
as visitors scroll through the site. The homepage also removed the introductory paragraph from the club president and instead highlighted the club attributes, such as who the club is, by utilizing shorter descriptions. As Redish (2012) notes, “Don’t use a paragraph to explain the site. Don’t put paragraph-long mission statements on the home page. Most people won’t read them” (p. 75). Therefore, Team Red’s homepage relies on the club’s logo and name as a means of recognition.</p2><br /><br />

<h3 style="margin-left: 3em; text-indent: 0px; color: black; font-size: 28px;">Sitebuilder Research</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 2.3em">In addition to creating two wireframe designs, one member conducted research on template site builders to report on their ease of use. These findings were then compiled into a document (see <a href="resources/Site-Research.pdf">Appendix E</a>) and incorporated into the final recommendations.
There are a multitude of website builder platforms one can use to customize and publish a new site. Considering various available platforms, Team Red analyzed three popular options that are easily accessible and free (paid options were available if desired): WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace. Each site was examined based upon desirable attributes and features that could aid the MAHC in upgrading their club website. Additionally, as ease of use was a significant factor expressed by Daphne, each site was rated on a usability scale for people over the age of fifty. The overall findings denote Wix as the easiest to use and understand while also offering a number of the desired features.</p2><br />

<h3 style="margin-left: 3em; text-indent: 0px; color: black; font-size: 28px;">Prototype Design</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 2.3em">After assembling all wireframe designs and desired features, Team Red proposes transitioning content to a prototype. A prototype “is a middle to high fidelity representation of the final product, which simulates user interface interaction” (Treder, 2016). A prototype also allows a user to experience the content and interactions with the interface and test interactions similar to the final product (Treder, 2016). This prototype could be created through the use of a site builder, such as Wix. In conjunction with progressing design concepts to prototypes, Team Red recommends the incorporation of usability testing for product evaluation. This could aid in improving site visitor experience as well as confirm that the new design updates are successfully calibrated to the intended audience.</p2><br />

<h3 style="margin-left: 1.2em; text-indent: 0px;">SITE RECOMMENDATIONS & FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 1.9em; margin-right: 2.3em">Team Red compiled recommendations and considerations for the Minnesota Austin Healey Club into a table (see <a href="resources/MAHC-Recommendations.pdf">Appendix F</a>).<br /><br />

Based on the needs analysis, Redish's (2012) web design guidelines, and discussions within weekly team meetings, Team Red generated a set of recommendations intended to streamline the user experience. Broadly, the team drew on Redish's framing of content as conversation to imagine a redesigned website that would work for users with varying digital literacies and in varying use contexts (e.g., on a mobile device during an event) while conveying the character of the club.<br /><br />

Given the variety of reasons one might visit the MAHC website, Team Red believes that the redesigned main page would function most effectively as a pathway page with the content area structured around common site visitor questions (e.g., "How do I join the club?") (see <a href="resources/wireframev2.png">Appendix B</a> & <a href="resources/MAHC-Mobile.png">Appendix D</a>). This area would enable quick, easy access to site content. The recommended main page redesign includes a scrollable calendar sidebar that displays the club's upcoming events. The slideshow located near the top of all site pages, as well as the "Recent Newsletter" and "Blast from the Past" (a randomized link to an archived newsletter) are intended to represent the club character.<br /><br />

For accessibility considerations, Team Red recommends enabling page and text resizing options, using alt-text for gallery images and other site images (e.g., logo), and high size and color contrast to assist users with low vision. Additionally, Team Red recommends utilizing a horizontal navigation menu across the site, using the color scheme present in the Austin Healey logo (red, white, blue) for the theme of the site, and rewording link verbiage to active verbs (“calls to action”). Finally, the use of a content management system could simplify processes and updates for the future webmaster of the site. After investigating several options Team Red recommends Wix given its ease of use and features (see <a href="resources/Site-Research.pdf">Appendix E</a>).<br /><br />
